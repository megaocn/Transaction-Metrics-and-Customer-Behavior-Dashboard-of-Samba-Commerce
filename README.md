# Transaction Metrics and Customer Behavior Dashboard of Samba Commerce

## Project Overview
The project has been done for Data Visualization Individual Assignment by RevoU. Inspired by [Samba Commerce Dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bd7Afsw7KutUM-khimfnheSAehzWUpDxPL7i0WUvSDg/edit?usp=sharing), I did the Exploratory Data Visualization (EDV) in tableau, as well as data cleaning in Tableau to convert data type and handle irrelevant value.

## Project Summary
From the data exploration, I discovered the problem that there is a low retention rate in 2021 (0.33%) and the longest period from customer's order date to deliver date (13 days). Hence, to make a right suggestion based on user preferences, RFM segmentation is needed. From segmentation, we showed that we have only a few Best Customers (257 from 48K+ customers).
